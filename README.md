## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the YAML file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly accessible, in addition to restricting DDoS attacks to the network.
- The load balancers protect the accessibility aspects of the security networks that have been established. The jump box is the only point of vulnerability within the virtual network and is protected through the security rules that are implemented. The jump box is not required to be powered on for the remaining virtual machines to be on and operational.  

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the logs and system traffic.
- Filebeat watches for the logs generated by the network. 
- Metricbeat records system traffic to be converted to logs and used with filebeat. 

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.

| Name     | Function  | IP Address | Operating System |
|----------|-----------|------------|------------------|
| Jump Box | Gateway   | 10.0.0.4   | Linux            |
|Web-1 VM  |DVWA Server| 10.0.0.7   | Linux            |
|Web-2 VM  |DVWA Server| 10.0.0.8   | Linux            |
|Web-3 VM  |DVWA Server| 10.0.0.9   | Linux            |

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the ELK machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
- Host IP address 
- Jump-Box IP address

Machines within the network can only be accessed by Jump-Box-Provisioner.
- The Jump_Box VM is allowed to access the ELK VM via SSH on port 22 with Public IP Address for the ELK VM.

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name     | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Jump Box | Yes                 | Host IP Address      |
| ELK      | Yes                 | Host IP Address      |
| Web-1 VM | No                  | Jump Box IP          |
| Web-2 VM | No                  | Jump Box IP          |
| Web-3 VM | No                  | Jump Box IP          |

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because the configurations can be constistantly installed and maintained across multiple machines and deployed on multiple servers.  

The playbook implements the following tasks:
- Install Docker.io
- Install PYTHON-PIP3
- Install Docker module via PIP3
- Command to increase Virtual Memory
- Download and Launch ELK container

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
- Web-1 VM (10.0.0.7)
- Web-2 VM (10.0.0.8)
- Web-3 VM (10.0.0.9)

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
- Filebeat
- Metricbeat

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
- Filebeat collects log files that contain log events that are then shipped into a monitoring cluster. The logs are then accessible through the Monitoring page on Kibana.  -Filebeat collets: audit logs, deprecation logs, GC logs, sever logs and slow logs.

- Metricbeat collets system-wide and per-process statistics about the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and memory while the machines are running.

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the install-elk.yml file to /etc/ansible.
- Update the host file to include the Elk-Server VM Private IP.
- Run the install-elk.yml playbook, and navigate to http://[public IP for ELk server]:5601/app/kibana to ensure the installation worked as expected.
